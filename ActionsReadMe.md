# Action Classes Documentation

In this game, actions are performed by interacting with the environment, other characters, or oneself. Each action is represented by a class that inherits from the `Action` base class.
These classes define various actions that can be performed in the game. The design follows the strategy design pattern, where each action is encapsulated into its own class, allowing for interchangeable behavior at runtime.
## Action Class Hierarchy

- `Action`: Base class for all actions.
- `Left`: Action to turn the player character left.
- `Right`: Action to turn the player character right.
- `Walk`: Action to move the player character in a certain direction.
- `Talk`: Action to initiate a conversation with a character.
- `Shout`: Action to shout or make a loud noise.
- `Look`: Action to observe the surroundings or inspect an object.
- `Take`: Action to pick up an item or interact with the environment to acquire something.
- `Attack`: Action to engage in combat with another character.
- `AttackDragon`: Specialized version of the attack action specifically for combat with dragons.

## Class Descriptions

- `Action`: Abstract base class defining the interface for all actions.
- `ActionResponse`: Abstract base class representing the response generated by an action.
- `StringActionResponse`: Derived class of `ActionResponse` specialized for responses in string format.

## Usage

Each action class implements the `Act` method, which executes the action and returns an `ActionResponse`. The `ActionResponse` encapsulates the data generated by the action, which can be used to provide feedback to the player.

For example:

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<ActionResponse> response = actions.at(command).get()->Act(dungeon, player);
